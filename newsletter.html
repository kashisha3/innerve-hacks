        <p><h2><u> No New Year For Women: Same Old Gender Violence In Only The First Week Of 2022</u></h2></p>

        <p>It would have been impossibly silly to imagine, or even hope, that gender violence in 2022 would magically be restrained. No woman tuned in to the reality of what her compatriotic sisterhood across the world faces daily, and has been facing all through the history, would be naive enough to be optimistic about a year as the year of change for gender violence. But one was expecting the resignation, the rage, the persecution to set in after at least until a few days of the new year passed.</p><br>

        <p>The first week of 2022 has been a complete downer in terms of gender issues for India. Rapes, assaults, harassment, cyber-attacks, abuse, degradation - the year has started on an outrageous note with all kinds of violence against women sustaining as they dominantly did last year. There are no new headlines.</p><br>

        <p> Is it really a new year for women in this country? It just seems like women are living the same reality over and over again, every single year. We have for ages been waiting to see, let alone arrive at, the light at the end of the tunnel.</p><br>

    <h2>Crimes against women saw over 63% rise in 2021 so far</h2>

    <p>Rape cases rose to 833 this year from 580 in same period in 2020
        Crime against women in the Capital increased by 63.3% in the first six months of 2021 as compared to 2020, data shared by Delhi Police showed.</p>
        
        <p>The data states that rape cases saw an increase of 43% from 580 till June 15 last year to 833 this year, molestation jumped by 39% from 733 to 1,022, kidnapping of women from 1,026 to 1,580, abduction of women from 46 to 159, and dowry deaths from 47 to 56.</p>

       <h2>Heinous crimes</h2>

<p>In the corresponding period last year, Delhi witnessed four cases of dacoity, 226 murder, 236 attempt to murder, 701 robbery, 681 riot cases and eight kidnapping for ransom, the data stated.</p><br>

<p>It's pertinent to note that the number of riot cases came down significantly this year as communal riots broke out in north-east Delhi in February last year following anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests.</p><br>

<p>According to the data, the number of non-heinous crimes has increased by 8.5%. Till June 15 this year, a total of 1,20,980 cases of non-heinous crime have been reported while the number stood at 1,11,419 last year.</p><br>

<p>The data showed there were 1,217 more cases of snatching reported in 2021 as compared to 2021 with 3,829 cases of snatching this time and 2,612 in last year. The total number of cases of hurt, burglary, motor vehicle theft and house theft stood at 493, 1,173, 15,667 and 938 respectively as compared to 421, 839, 13130, and 875 last year.</p><br>

<p>The data showed that fatal and non-fatal accidents rose from 392 and 1,260 cases in 2020 to 449 and 1,497 cases this year, respectively.</p><br>

    <h2>Women leaders shine in the face of COVID-19</h2>

    <p>Governments across the world worked to respond to COVID-19, with research suggesting that in countries where women lead, the responses were quicker, more effective and stronger. In countries with women leaders, including New Zealand, Germany, Finland, Bangladesh and more, the quick and decisive actions of the women in charge led to lower cases and lower deaths</p>
        
        <p>Even though COVID-19 has demonstrated the important role of women in leadership and decision-making, as of December 2020, there are only 22 countries with women serving as Heads of State and/or Government worldwide. As we look ahead to building back better in the future, women's leadership is critical to success.</p>

       <h2>US elects first woman vice-president</h2>

<p>In November, Kamala Harris became the first woman vice-president-elect of the United States, shattering barriers that have kept men entrenched at the highest levels of American politics for many years. Following her swearing-in in January 2021, she will join the ranks of other female vice-presidents around the world, in countries including Bulgaria, Nicaragua, Liberia, Costa Rica, Venezuela, The Gambia, South Sudan, and others.

    US President-elect Joe Biden also announced an all women senior communications team, a first for the White House.</p><br>

<h2>Scotland makes period products free for all</h2>
    <p>The Scottish parliament voted unanimously in favour of the Period Products bill in November, making Scotland the first country to allow free and universal access to menstrual products –including tampons and pads – in public buildings including schools and universities.
